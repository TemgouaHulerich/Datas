- About     About REMO         Mission 

​The purpose of REMO is to establish and coordinate an Emergency Medical Services System which will properly provide the region with needed emergency medical services using all the accepted modalities of life support including pre-hospital basic and advanced life support, properly staffed hospital emergency departments, and the designation of regional critical care centers. 

​Furthermore REMO will stimulate, guide, and nurture the development of such a system with the quality of excellence, placing individual departments, hospitals, organizations, committees, physicians, and ancillary medical personnel secondary to the emergency medical needs of the people. About REMO 

The Regional Emergency Medical Organization of the Hudson-Mohawk Valley (REMO) is one of 18 State-designated Program Agencies servicing the needs of New York State pre-hospital EMS providers. REMO operates within a six county region of New York State that includes the counties of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Schenectady. These 3500 square miles include a population of over 900,000 and account for an annual call volume in excess of 150,000. 

REMO consists of: the REMSCO (Regional Emergency Medical Services Council), the REMAC (Regional Medical Advisory Committee), and the Regional EMS Program Agency.

The REMSCO is authorized under Article 30 of New York State Public Health Law (section 3002) as a non-profit corporation consisting of both pre-hospital and hospital providers and serves as the governing body of the organization.

The REMAC is authorized under Article 30 (section 3004-a) to provide Medical Control, system-wide quality improvement, and educational programs for all regional pre-hospital providers.

The Regional EMS Program Agency is authorized under Article 30 (section 3000-a) to facilitate the development and operation of an emergency medical services system within the region, and provide support staff for the Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC).

REMO is also responsible for providing EMS Education in the REMO Region.

 Howard “Doc” Westney, MD 601 

​The passing of Howard “Doc” Westney, MD inspired REMO to contact some of our original paramedics (and historians) to gather, reminisce and share their “Westney” stories with the region.  They came together to reflect on one man’s vision, mission, and fight to provide quality pre-hospital care—- and to pay homage to the founding father of the Regional Emergency Medical Organization—-MD 601.

     The Sweet Treats Story 

Sweet Treats founders Jennifer and Chris never imagined that this whole “ice cream truck thing” would become their full-time jobs when they started back in 2008. In fact, the idea began for an entirely different purpose – a form of rehabilitation for Chris. 

You see, Chris was recovering from a serious spinal cord injury that left him partially paralyzed. The couple thought that this would be a great hobby to keep Chris active while also being something fun they could do together. From that moment on, Chris spent his days dreaming up the fantastic ice cream and dessert trucks that you see today. And well, the rest is history! 

Sweet Treats is now celebrating its 10-year anniversary and looking forward to many more years serving the San Diego community.   We Are The Best at What We Do   

Sweet Treats is San Diego’s premier gourmet ice cream and dessert catering and event truck company. Serving only the best premium ice cream, local desserts, and nostalgic favorites, our team provides a totally unique, fun, and professional experience for your next corporate event or private party. 

Our fleet of retro-themed trucks and motorcycle sidecars can accommodate groups from 30-3000 and have been the WOW factor at hundreds of different kinds of events and parties throughout Southern California since 2008, including: 

Client or employee appreciation
 Grand openings
 Weddings and engagements
 Birthdays
 Anniversaries
 Graduations
 Reunions
 And anything else you can imagine! 

We are the best at what we do because of our strong values and our belief that we are meant to be good stewards of all that God has entrusted to us. The Sweet Treats team carries this belief in all of the work that we do, and it shows! Much of our business comes from repeat customers or referrals, so you can be confident that our clients are happy and satisfied with the service we provide.           Contact Sweet Treats

 Looking for something to offer besides Ice Cream? Well, let us introduce you to the Sweet Treats Dessert Truck!  

Our Dessert Truck was designed to make you feel like you are at home in your own kitchen. We built our Dessert Truck from the wheels up and added custom cabinetry and granite countertops, then equipped it with a refrigerated display case, freezer and a sound system with outdoor speakers and a flat screen TV. 

With a vast variety of treats, we have something for everybody’s sweet tooth! From cookies, brownies, and cupcakes to chocolate bombs, tiramisu’s and cheesecake towers, just to name a few! Some of our favorites are the cookies stuffed with a brownie in the middle and our chocolate covered bacon! 

Would you like a Chai Tea or a Vanilla Latte with your desserts? We now offer hot drinks as an option to your catering package! San Diego Dessert Truck Catering 

The Dessert Truck is the perfect way to add something sweet to your next event! It’s like a mobile dessert buffet brought right to you! We can customize the menu for your specific needs and dietary restrictions. Want to do something different and unique for your San Diego wedding reception? Have the Sweet Treats Truck there to serve individual gourmet desserts instead of the standard wedding cake! The possibilities are endless!

 Make your next special event extra special with a visit from a Sweet Treats ice cream or dessert truck or ice cream motorcycle sidecar! 

With over ten years of experience providing ice cream catering for special events, Sweet Treats knows how to create a professional yet fun presentation that will really wow your event guests. Our fleet of retro-themed trucks and motorcycles have been serving up smiles and yummy treats across San Diego County and beyond since 2008.

We stock our trucks and motorcycles with only the best premium ice cream and local-made desserts from our partner bakeries in San Diego. And of course, we have all the classics that you remember from your childhood.

Our experienced staff, transparent pricing, and high-quality products are the reasons why customers keep coming back. In fact, the foundation of our success is our repeat and referral client business.

   Don’t take our word for it…   

Sweet Treats was a huge hit with our team. It would be hard to say which dessert was the favorite, because people were raving about all of them. Anything that wasn’t served from your truck was brought in to our break rooms, where they didn’t last for long. We appreciate your artistry, your great customer service, and your willingness to be flexible. 

Many thanks,
 Qualcomm
      

Thank you very much for coming out to our home this past Saturday for my son Everett’s 10th Birthday. It was one of his wishes that came true and definitely his favorite birthday present. All of our guests were surprised and extremely happy. The moment Chris rolled up everyone’s faces lit up with joy (kids and parents). It was a unique experience for all of our guests as they’ve never attended a party with a dessert food truck present. 

Chris did a phenomenal job. The desserts were very delicious, the presentation was brilliant, and your services exceeded our expectations. We especially loved and appreciated you allowing Everett to serve his guests from the truck. 

Raul     

Planning an event for 200+ people was a bit overwhelming. But, Sweet Treats put all my worries to rest and we all had such a great time during our Ice Cream Social. I’d like to extend a very big thank you to your staff! It was a perfect hot, summer day for some delicious ice cream and you/Sweet Treats definitely delivered! I greatly appreciate your professionalism, punctuality, and your flexibility to accommodate our schedule. I was able to plan an event on a budget and tight schedule and we all had such a great time. Thanks again and I look forward to working with you in the future. Best regards, LG Electronics, Inc

 Looking for something to offer besides Ice Cream? Well, let us introduce you to the Sweet Treats Dessert Truck!  

Our Dessert Truck was designed to make you feel like you are at home in your own kitchen. We built our Dessert Truck from the wheels up and added custom cabinetry and granite countertops, then equipped it with a refrigerated display case, freezer and a sound system with outdoor speakers and a flat screen TV. 

With a vast variety of treats, we have something for everybody’s sweet tooth! From cookies, brownies, and cupcakes to chocolate bombs, tiramisu’s and cheesecake towers, just to name a few! Some of our favorites are the cookies stuffed with a brownie in the middle and our chocolate covered bacon! 

Would you like a Chai Tea or a Vanilla Latte with your desserts? We now offer hot drinks as an option to your catering package! San Diego Dessert Truck Catering 

The Dessert Truck is the perfect way to add something sweet to your next event! It’s like a mobile dessert buffet brought right to you! We can customize the menu for your specific needs and dietary restrictions. Want to do something different and unique for your San Diego wedding reception? Have the Sweet Treats Truck there to serve individual gourmet desserts instead of the standard wedding cake! The possibilities are endless!

- “As a pediatrician, I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day. I have been doing that for more than 20 years! They crack and bleed. I have tried every product out there….some are too oily, some burn as they soak in, some get absorbed and don’t make a difference. Waxelene is different. It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used!” Jill AirolaMD FAAP
- “As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.” Elke Von FreudenbergCelebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon
- “I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.” Joanna Simkincelebrity makeup artist

The Waxelene team goes the extra mile to bring you the most luxurious and effective formulations at the best possible prices. Using our patented aeration process and extra love, we make breathable, soothing botanical ointments for all of your skin care needs and more! Waxelene’s Story: 

Waxelene’s Story began in San Francisco California where Todd Cooper and Ejyo Remington set out to create an alternative to petroleum jelly using all natural ingredients. After countless trial batches, they created a process that made the silky, breathable, waterproof texture known today as Waxelene. After giving it to friends to try, everyone was begging for more. Todd and Ejyo put this magical creation in glass jars and brought it to local stores. It was an instant hit! Waxelene was a best seller in all 40 Northern California Whole Foods less than a year after being created. It wasn’t long before Waxelene was found on the shelves of over 15,000 retail stores, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and many more! 

Waxelene is currently developing new products for Waxelene and continue to innovate the use of pure ingredients in personal care. We want to make your daily rituals 100% healthy. 

Waxelene appreciates all of its customers and hopes to make lives better everyday. We are very grateful for the opportunity to share these formulations with you!

- “As a pediatrician, I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day. I have been doing that for more than 20 years! They crack and bleed. I have tried every product out there….some are too oily, some burn as they soak in, some get absorbed and don’t make a difference. Waxelene is different. It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used!” Jill AirolaMD FAAP
- “As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.” Elke Von FreudenbergCelebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon
- “I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.” Joanna Simkincelebrity makeup artist

“I use it on all my clients! Truly the best balm ever!”-Olga Pirmatova, Celebrity Makeup Artist  

“An essential in my makeup and mommy bag! One of my favorite products and mommy ‘survival’ essentials!”-Lily Aldridge, Supermodel, Victorias Secret Angel  

“As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.”-Elke Von Freudenberg, Celebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon  

“As a professional surfer, based in Northern California I use wetsuits a lot! That means putting on damp or wet wetsuits is inevitable, which means skin rashes are bound to occur… when that happens, it’s awesome to count on Waxelene to sooth those rashes and know that it’s a natural product. I also use Waxelene for burnt or chapped lips – a regular occurrence, if you are in the ocean a lot!” -Joao DeMacedo, Finalist in 2011/2012 Big Wave World Tour  

“My favorite beauty product for myself and my clients!”-Beverly Fink, Celebrity Makeup Artist  

“Waxelene is a must-have! I use it every day!”-Elena Hight, Professional Snow Boarder  

“I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day for work. I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. Waxelene is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema.”-Jill Airola, MD FAAP  

“As a dude, do you know how bad petroleum jelly is for your skin? Of course not, why would you? You’re a dude. I had absolutely no idea, either… At best, petroleum jelly literally does nothing: It provides no nourishment and is a temporary solution to dry skin. At worst, the risks associated with carcinogens just aren’t worth it. Waxelene is the anti-petroleum jelly. Rather than using petroleum jelly or Carmex and it’s harsh chemical mixture, Waxelene actively heals the skin!”-Paul Edie, Barbershop Blog  

“Waxelene offers the perfect balance of being both a natural product and working in many adverse conditions. It keeps rashes away and doesn’t impact the longevity of my not so natural surf trunks and wetsuits. This product suits my lifestyle really well and I am glad it’s on the market.” -Ryan Seelbach, Mavericks Invitational contestant  

“I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.”-Joanna Simkin, celebrity makeup artist  

“I just wanted to let you know that in just three days of using Waxelene as my nightly moisturizer the eczema that I have been struggling with for years on my face and around my mouth has improved significantly! And my face has an all around glow that I never thought I could have with my terrible combination skin. Waxelene doesn’t break me out at all, in fact, I think it may be helping to heal my breakouts and blemishes which is another miracle! Thank you so much for this incredibly simple and amazing product that has returned so much self confidence to this twenty-four year old. This is my go to miracle solution that I will be recommending to anyone who may compliment my skin in the future…because I’ll be expecting compliments now! I can’t thank you enough!!”-K.C.  

“OMG! I love it! I have had this product for less than 24 hours and I can feel the difference already. I am a nurse and my hands were so dry the skin just tears and splits over my knuckles and bleeds all over… not cool to bleed on your patients! Any other creams, lotions and potions I’ve tried would just burn when I tried them on my raw/dry hands…but not Waxelene! It’s fantastic. I feel like my hands are healing and there is nothing painful when I put it on my skin. I will be a customer for life. Keep up the great work!! You have no idea how amazed I am, I’m going back to buy all the stock I can find and give some to my friends and family too! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! You have no idea how happy I am right now! Such a small thing, but such a great thing! Thank you again!”-Brenda D., Toronto  

“My mom had severe dry skin from poor circulation – I brought over a large jar of Waxelene and it’s like a miracle her skin looks amazing! Thank you from my mom. She was so uncomfortable and now has relief at least from the dry skin.”-Laurie Ehrhardt  

“No product out on the market has ever provided such relief to dry chapped hands & skin like Waxelene! The best part about it is it’s petroleum free & has only 4 all natural ingredients….. It’s on my vanity counter right now ready to be used at a moments notice. During the winter, my sons eczema becomes so inflamed, other products cause burning & irritation & he can’t take the pain. Since we’ve been using this, I no longer have my son crying from the burn. He gladly lathers it on & feels content & by the next day the inflammation has been reduced to nothing. I’m grateful that I received samples in my Conscious Box monthly subscription. I would have never seen this product. I’m happy that I’m able to find it at CVS & gladly tell everyone about you. A local health food Store will now be carrying your product because I marketed you all to them. Very content!”-Corie Benavidez Dilley  

“I recently moved to Pittsburgh, PA, and the winter months have done a number on my hands. They have been so dry that the skin actually cracks and bleeds! I recently started using Waxelene, and not only does my skin look healthy now, but it feels supple and soft. It works so quickly, and it feels great! I now use it every day, as part of my regular routine. Thank you!”-Jill Fischer, PsyD  

“Hey guys, just wanted to tell you how much I love your product! I’m lying here with the flu this week, and my nose was getting very irritated from all the tissues. I happened to remember that I had received a sample size of Waxelene in my Conscious Box last month, so I decided to try it. Wow, what a life saver! Even though I feel miserable, my nose is wonderful! Not greasy or sticky, doesn’t smell AND I won’t have that ugly, flaky dry skin nose next week. Thanks, guys! I’m hooked! :)”-Jennifer Gobel-Lewis  

“Holy FREAKING cow! I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I must confess, when I first opened the sample container and squeezed out the Waxelene, I was taken aback a bit. I was a little afraid of the consistency. I used it in place of my petroleum jelly on my legs pre-shaving (to prevent the loss of moisture that occurs in the shower and causes the itchy dryness afterwards… petroleum jelly ROCKS at this as it is water soluble) and OMG, not only did it work just as well, it worked BETTER. Normally, the Vaseline leaves behind a greasy mess, what with Vaseline being Vaseline and all, but Waxelene did NOT, it gave me all of the BENEFITS of Vaseline. The still moist, not dried or itchy skin post shave, the smooth, shininess of Vaseline, but not all the overly greasiness. It was just right and that is JUST PERFECT.”-Mary B  

“We have tried so many expensive skin care products in hopes of helping our childrens’ eczema and chronic dry skin patches… with little to no success. Then we found Waxelene at Whole Foods and their skin is now clear and baby soft!! It is WONDERFUL! Even my mother (who swears up and down about her 20 years of success with petroleum jelly) felt and saw the difference in my children’s skin and said she would be open to trying it!! It is a fantastic product and I am so glad we have found it. We have been using it for months and now the whole family uses it. What a treasure!”-Teresa N  

“I have tried everything for Chafing..larger women have this problem, walking, running, biking etc. I put this on and within a minute there was instant relief! The next morning it had healed the area entirely! Absolutely amazing!”-MJS  

“I have used this recently as a hair pomade, it is the best ever. Oil pomades are terrible because of the petrolatum, mineral oils, and other harmful ingredients, but they work the best. Water based pomades are not great, and will never give you that Cary Grant hold or shine. Finally, a hair pomade that is great for your hair and works! Nice work!”-SB  

“(I am of African American and Arabic decent and) I apply it to my wavy hair and scalp, lips, body, especially hands and feet (Even my face which I usually avoid putting anything on because it usually breaks me out due to my combination of dry AND oily sensitive skin). Also, I have completely stopped using to treat my eczema. Waxelene works just fine. I feel better about my skin absorbing organic products opposed to petroleum jelly laying on it clogging my pores (not allowing my hair to breathe and grow to its full potential). I love your product. Thank you for putting forth an effort to create something for us who prefer the more natural products.”-A.N.  

“I’m so glad I decided to try Waxelene. I’ve found that I have to mix other body lotions with something else, just to get enough moisture into my skin. But Waxelene by itself is just perfect for my often dry skin. I really like the smooth consistency and light, honey scent. I especially appreciate that after using Waxelene, I can go for hours not needing to reapply anything at all.”-O.B.  

“I have eczema and I’m always on the hunt for a product like this. I just found Waxelene today at Rainbow Grocery and I love the glass jar and the 9 oz. size. Thank you for making this product!”-J.M.  

“We use Waxelene for ourselves and our baby, we love it! It’s great for dry hands, and helps diaper rash too.”-The Jacobsens  

“I recently purchased Waxelene and it works great. I put it on my feet at night and it makes them feel extra soft the next day!”-Lora  

“As a surfer, I often get a rash around my neck from my wetsuit. I used to use the old PJ, but no longer. Waxelene really helps and stays on while I’m in the water.”-John M.  

“I’ve been using Waxelene as a cycling chamois creme for a couple of weeks and….it’s great. Better (fewer saddle sores) than more expensive products like DZ Nuts, Ozone, Assos. After a four hour double day yesterday, including a mostly in-the-saddle climb up Rist Canyon Road (20K climb) –nothing.”-R.B.  

“A friend gave this to me to take to Philadelphia to use on my incisions post surgery. I apply it to my face where I had the surgery because I was starting to peel like a snake! Waxelene completely covers the dryness and no one can tell that I am flaking! I love your product!”-S.L.  

“I had some eczema / dry spots on my eye lids that were pretty bad. I had been dealing with it for about 2 months. I tried hydrocortisone, creams, lotions, A&D ointment – and nothing worked. I used the Waxelene for the past 4 days, and it cleared up!!! I am so excited… lol. I can honestly say that I will be buying this product religiously for my skin care. Thank you again for introducing me to this great product.”-K.B.  

“Thank you so much for making this product! Although not a regular shopper at Whole Foods, I was there looking for organic chocolate stocking stuffers for Christmas when I saw a gentleman with your display. One little dab and I knew I needed this stuff. It’s really dry here in Colorado all year round, and this is the best hand/foot/face/elbow/scratch/lip product I’ve ever used. Even better than Deep Emollient Night Creme, which I’ve used for a long time for all the above mentioned uses. I’ll be picking up jars of this for several friends on my next shopping foray. This stuff is the nuts! And it smells great!”-Tina P.  

“I use Waxelene on my lips, hands and granddaughters bottom.”-Allen Cooper MD, Professor Emeritus Stanford University  

“Waxelene is the best! I have been using Waxelene for a couple weeks now and it has made all the difference in the world! I use it on my face as a moisturizer and it does not only leave my face moisturized; but it also imparts a healthy dewy glow. I like it better than any moisturizer I have used before and I know I will be using it for years to come. Thanks for making such a great product.”-D.T.  

“I finally found your product at Whole Foods…so excited…so far it has made my lips soft and less dry…my hands as well…I bought a small jar but will bump up to the bigger jar in order to moisturize the entire family…Thanks for such an awesome product!”-Y.E.  

“My whole family uses Waxelene. Especially my daughter. She gets dry, scaly patches on her face but every other product she’s tried (including from her doctor!) break her skin out. Waxelene is like a miracle for her! She uses it every night and it does wonders! Thank you for such a wonderful product!!”-J.L.  

“I just want to tell you how much I love Waxelene. I’m trying to find natural, good-for-me, good-for-the-planet alternatives to the products I normally use and Waxelene has become part of my beauty routine. I use it as a lip moisturizer, for dry patches on my face, and on my hands and cuticles. I’ve tossed the icky jars of Vaseline I used to use and will never go back to. Thank you for this product!”-Joanna L.  

“I just want to say I love love Waxelene!!! This product has worked so well on my baby’s bottom and helped get rid of his diaper rash. Thank you!”-Heather Brown Adams  

“I am SO glad I found waxelene at my local Bed, Bath & Beyond store. I have been looking for an alternative to vaselene for my lips for some time and nothing else I’ve used has worked. I wanted the same kind of coverage/protection that vaselene gave me and your product is wonderful. It feels just as protective yet even better than vaselene. So so glad that you make this. “-JAB  

“Waxelene has been awesome on my daughters diaper rash! I had tried 4 other (supposed) natural products that did nothing to help, but only 2 applications of Waxelene and rash was GONE! Awesome stuff!”-Patty Bloom Bucken  

“I love waxelene! I use it for hands, feet and diaper area. I really love it to soothe the red chapped skin on my baby’s neck. It also smells so heavenly! Thank you for making such a wonderful product!”-Heather Hobbs  

“I love it because its natural. I use it on my hands, arms, legs, to remove makeup, under my eyes at night, and rub a bit into my eyebrows before plucking to ease the pain. #waxelene.”-Terri Lynn Shelton Barger  

“I love Waxelene because it is the ONLY thing that helps my daughters eczema!”-Joelle Sailers  

“Why do I love Waxelene? Because it removes the caked on mascara under my eyes, it moisturizes my “chicken skin” arms, it is my night time face moisturizer, my lip balm. If you have skin on your body…you absolutely need this product.”-Rebecca DeLawder Linn  

“I first discovered Waxelene when I picked up a tube at the grocery store. When I got a bad sunburn on July 4th, I was frantically looking for something to soothe the burn. I applied Waxelene and it worked! I didn’t even peel! Now I use it for everything from a makeup remover, lip moisturizer, on my cuticles, on my feet, the list is endless! I love you Waxelene!”-Kimberly Todd  

“I LOVE Waxelene because it’s amazing on my sons super sensitive skin!!! I give it to all new mothers, it’s definitely a must have.”-Jennifer Jensen  

“This is my first time hearing about an alternative to petroleum jelly and I was excited when I got chosen to try it. I mostly use it on my lips and I can definitely feel and see an improvement to my lips which can be dry or cracked sometimes whenever I use lip product. I also tried it on my face where I have dry spots. There’s improvement in those areas as well. Waxelene doesn’t feel heavy or suffocating.”-Jean C  

“I really lovee Waxelene. First, I used it as a chapstick (me & the boyfriend had pretty chapped lips) and it worked amazingly. Then we used it on dry parts of our skin, once again, works amazing. I love everything about this product – very natural, very soft. Highly recommended!”-Marleebaby  

“Waxelene is a great replacement for petroleum jelly. I used it to remove my makeup, on my child’s diaper area, and to moisturize and it did the same job petroleum jelly does but better. When I smell it I can smell the Rosemary oil in it and I like that it doesn’t have an un natural perfume smell. I definitely would recommend this product and will probably purchase it after I have gone through all the samples.”-Marshall  

“OMG I LOVE THIS! First of all I have very sensitive skin. I had no issues with this product. It isn’t greasy, it has taken 10 years off my hands!!! The smell is a lightly wood (of some type. I just can’t put my finger on this pleasant smell). It does take awhile to be completely absorbed into my hands (which isn’t a bad thing since it isn’t greasy).”-Lori T  

“Waxelene is the perfect substitute for petroleum jelly. In fact I’d go so far as to say that it’s superior to petroleum jelly. It has a pleasant mild scent, and actually absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy layer like petroleum jelly tends to do. I use Waxelene regular!”-April J  

“I absolutely love this product I was glad I could try it I was suffering from really chap lips starting 3 days before I got and I dont like others because they feel like greasy but this one went on smooth and helped heal my poor burning lips. I would recommend for sure – it works great. Gonna buy it again!”-Amber  

“I absolutely love this for removing eye makeup residue after washing my face. I use a waterproof mascara and when I washed my face I would still have the black rings under my eyes from it. I would just dab a little bit of Waxelene on it making sure not to get any in my eyes. let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute and it would all wipe right off. Didn’t even have to rub hard. LOVE IT for this. Took it all right off. I also used it for lip balm and it did a great job!!! The only thing I didn’t like is that it came out kind of clumpy but I assume that was from the type if sample package it was in. Great product.”-Stacy F  

“This is a very good product with a wide range of uses. Its light enough to wear on lips to prevent chapping and also good as a moisturizer for dry and cracking skin.I found it quite effective for my needs. I would recommend this product in place of regular Vaseline, Its light, wont clog your pores and has a great smell. Its worth purchasing since it has many uses.”-Roshall F  

“I received a sample of Waxelene from Swaggable. The first thing I noticed that it is made in the USA! Love that, and that it is all natural with only a handful of ingredients that I know and trust and as an animal advocate, proud to say this product is NOT tested on animals. I love that it is also herb infused with Rosemary. I am an avid home gardener, and used it on my hands after gardening. It glides on easily and it is clear. No greasy feel, and made my hands look and feel moisturized and well cared for. I also used it on my lips to prevent chapping. Again, went on effortlessly with no greasy film, and kept my lips soft and pampered. I would definitely recommend Waxelene to anyone that wants to use a chemical free beauty product!”-Kitty S  

“This, first of all, smells so much better than petroleum jelly. The texture is very smooth and not oily at all. I would purchase this product over the jelly. I like that it is made in America too!”-Carrie M  

“It’s a great all natural alternative to petroleum jelly. It smells great and it’s really useful on coarser textures for styling and moisturizing your hair without leaving your hair greasy. I can’t wait to find more uses for Waxelene, I love it!”-Mikoairaya                         Home | Shop | About | News | FAQ | Testimonials | Reviews | Terms and Conditions | Privacy Policy

The Waxelene team goes the extra mile to bring you the most luxurious and effective formulations at the best possible prices. Using our patented aeration process and extra love, we make breathable, soothing botanical ointments for all of your skin care needs and more! Waxelene’s Story: 

Waxelene’s Story began in San Francisco California where Todd Cooper and Ejyo Remington set out to create an alternative to petroleum jelly using all natural ingredients. After countless trial batches, they created a process that made the silky, breathable, waterproof texture known today as Waxelene. After giving it to friends to try, everyone was begging for more. Todd and Ejyo put this magical creation in glass jars and brought it to local stores. It was an instant hit! Waxelene was a best seller in all 40 Northern California Whole Foods less than a year after being created. It wasn’t long before Waxelene was found on the shelves of over 15,000 retail stores, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and many more! 

Waxelene is currently developing new products for Waxelene and continue to innovate the use of pure ingredients in personal care. We want to make your daily rituals 100% healthy. 

Waxelene appreciates all of its customers and hopes to make lives better everyday. We are very grateful for the opportunity to share these formulations with you!

Where do I buy Waxelene? 

You can buy Waxelene online here. You can find Waxelene at these retail locations. 

What makes Waxelene different? 

Waxelene is made with a patented aeration process that creates the first ever breathable waterproof barrier. Waxelene creates the same waterproof barrier doctors recommend, but has no petroleum or hydrogenated oils. This allows Waxelene to work better than petroleum jelly because it addresses all three aspects of skin care: a waterproof barrier, breathability and organic, natural oils. 

What is Waxelene? 

Waxelene is the petroleum jelly alternative – made from natural, pesticide-free beeswax and 3 of the highest quality natural & organic oils.  Waxelene is smooth, rich and creamy. Our patented aeration process allows the skin to breathe. 

What can it be used for? 

Waxelene can be used for many types of skin issues – from chapped lips to chafing to skin protection! It’s also great for various make-up applications, baby diaper irritation, skin conditions, removing makeup, after shave and many more uses. See our video for more info. 

What are the ingredients? 

Waxelene has only 4 natural and organic ingredients! Organic GMO-free soy oil, natural & unbleached raw beeswax, natural vitamin E oil and organic rosemary oil. No hidden ingredients, such as synthetic preservatives, dyes, perfumes, or thickeners. 

What is the texture like? 

Waxelene has a soft, rich, creamy texture that goes on clear and smooth. It protects skin for hours without feeling greasy. 

Is there petroleum in it? 

NO! There are absolutely no petroleum-based or petroleum-derived ingredients of any kind in Waxelene. 

Do the oils come from GMO (genetically modified) sources? 

No! Waxelene’s raw ingredients are obtained from certified organic, non-GMO suppliers. 

Is it safe for my baby? 

Yes! Many of our customers use Waxelene to their child’s skin with great success. Parents may want to do a small spot-test on their child’s skin to make sure that no reaction occurs. 

Is it safe for cloth diapers? 

Yes! Waxelene is safe for cloth diapers and will wash out. 

Can I use it on my pet? 

Yes, many of our customers use it on their pet’s skin. Check with your veterinarian first if you are uncertain or if you notice any sort of reaction. 

Is it tested on animals? 

No! Never have, never will! We are certified cruelty-free by PETA and Leaping Bunny, who are leading animal-rights groups. 

How long will my jar/tube stay good? 

Waxelene has a “best by” date of 3 years. It may last longer if kept at room temperature or in a cool place. However, avoid leaving Waxelene in a hot location for a length of time, since it is a natural product. 

Is Waxelene sustainable? 

Yes! Our ingredients are all natural, our facility is powered with 100% wind power, our boxes are all 100% recycled, and we source the most sustainable packaging we can get. We use recyclable glass jars and any plastics used are BPA-free. 

Where is Waxelene made? 

Waxelene is made in California, USA.

“I use it on all my clients! Truly the best balm ever!”-Olga Pirmatova, Celebrity Makeup Artist  

“An essential in my makeup and mommy bag! One of my favorite products and mommy ‘survival’ essentials!”-Lily Aldridge, Supermodel, Victorias Secret Angel  

“As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.”-Elke Von Freudenberg, Celebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon  

“As a professional surfer, based in Northern California I use wetsuits a lot! That means putting on damp or wet wetsuits is inevitable, which means skin rashes are bound to occur… when that happens, it’s awesome to count on Waxelene to sooth those rashes and know that it’s a natural product. I also use Waxelene for burnt or chapped lips – a regular occurrence, if you are in the ocean a lot!” -Joao DeMacedo, Finalist in 2011/2012 Big Wave World Tour  

“My favorite beauty product for myself and my clients!”-Beverly Fink, Celebrity Makeup Artist  

“Waxelene is a must-have! I use it every day!”-Elena Hight, Professional Snow Boarder  

“I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day for work. I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. Waxelene is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema.”-Jill Airola, MD FAAP  

“As a dude, do you know how bad petroleum jelly is for your skin? Of course not, why would you? You’re a dude. I had absolutely no idea, either… At best, petroleum jelly literally does nothing: It provides no nourishment and is a temporary solution to dry skin. At worst, the risks associated with carcinogens just aren’t worth it. Waxelene is the anti-petroleum jelly. Rather than using petroleum jelly or Carmex and it’s harsh chemical mixture, Waxelene actively heals the skin!”-Paul Edie, Barbershop Blog  

“Waxelene offers the perfect balance of being both a natural product and working in many adverse conditions. It keeps rashes away and doesn’t impact the longevity of my not so natural surf trunks and wetsuits. This product suits my lifestyle really well and I am glad it’s on the market.” -Ryan Seelbach, Mavericks Invitational contestant  

“I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.”-Joanna Simkin, celebrity makeup artist  

“I just wanted to let you know that in just three days of using Waxelene as my nightly moisturizer the eczema that I have been struggling with for years on my face and around my mouth has improved significantly! And my face has an all around glow that I never thought I could have with my terrible combination skin. Waxelene doesn’t break me out at all, in fact, I think it may be helping to heal my breakouts and blemishes which is another miracle! Thank you so much for this incredibly simple and amazing product that has returned so much self confidence to this twenty-four year old. This is my go to miracle solution that I will be recommending to anyone who may compliment my skin in the future…because I’ll be expecting compliments now! I can’t thank you enough!!”-K.C.  

“OMG! I love it! I have had this product for less than 24 hours and I can feel the difference already. I am a nurse and my hands were so dry the skin just tears and splits over my knuckles and bleeds all over… not cool to bleed on your patients! Any other creams, lotions and potions I’ve tried would just burn when I tried them on my raw/dry hands…but not Waxelene! It’s fantastic. I feel like my hands are healing and there is nothing painful when I put it on my skin. I will be a customer for life. Keep up the great work!! You have no idea how amazed I am, I’m going back to buy all the stock I can find and give some to my friends and family too! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! You have no idea how happy I am right now! Such a small thing, but such a great thing! Thank you again!”-Brenda D., Toronto  

“My mom had severe dry skin from poor circulation – I brought over a large jar of Waxelene and it’s like a miracle her skin looks amazing! Thank you from my mom. She was so uncomfortable and now has relief at least from the dry skin.”-Laurie Ehrhardt  

“No product out on the market has ever provided such relief to dry chapped hands & skin like Waxelene! The best part about it is it’s petroleum free & has only 4 all natural ingredients….. It’s on my vanity counter right now ready to be used at a moments notice. During the winter, my sons eczema becomes so inflamed, other products cause burning & irritation & he can’t take the pain. Since we’ve been using this, I no longer have my son crying from the burn. He gladly lathers it on & feels content & by the next day the inflammation has been reduced to nothing. I’m grateful that I received samples in my Conscious Box monthly subscription. I would have never seen this product. I’m happy that I’m able to find it at CVS & gladly tell everyone about you. A local health food Store will now be carrying your product because I marketed you all to them. Very content!”-Corie Benavidez Dilley  

“I recently moved to Pittsburgh, PA, and the winter months have done a number on my hands. They have been so dry that the skin actually cracks and bleeds! I recently started using Waxelene, and not only does my skin look healthy now, but it feels supple and soft. It works so quickly, and it feels great! I now use it every day, as part of my regular routine. Thank you!”-Jill Fischer, PsyD  

“Hey guys, just wanted to tell you how much I love your product! I’m lying here with the flu this week, and my nose was getting very irritated from all the tissues. I happened to remember that I had received a sample size of Waxelene in my Conscious Box last month, so I decided to try it. Wow, what a life saver! Even though I feel miserable, my nose is wonderful! Not greasy or sticky, doesn’t smell AND I won’t have that ugly, flaky dry skin nose next week. Thanks, guys! I’m hooked! :)”-Jennifer Gobel-Lewis  

“Holy FREAKING cow! I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I must confess, when I first opened the sample container and squeezed out the Waxelene, I was taken aback a bit. I was a little afraid of the consistency. I used it in place of my petroleum jelly on my legs pre-shaving (to prevent the loss of moisture that occurs in the shower and causes the itchy dryness afterwards… petroleum jelly ROCKS at this as it is water soluble) and OMG, not only did it work just as well, it worked BETTER. Normally, the Vaseline leaves behind a greasy mess, what with Vaseline being Vaseline and all, but Waxelene did NOT, it gave me all of the BENEFITS of Vaseline. The still moist, not dried or itchy skin post shave, the smooth, shininess of Vaseline, but not all the overly greasiness. It was just right and that is JUST PERFECT.”-Mary B  

“We have tried so many expensive skin care products in hopes of helping our childrens’ eczema and chronic dry skin patches… with little to no success. Then we found Waxelene at Whole Foods and their skin is now clear and baby soft!! It is WONDERFUL! Even my mother (who swears up and down about her 20 years of success with petroleum jelly) felt and saw the difference in my children’s skin and said she would be open to trying it!! It is a fantastic product and I am so glad we have found it. We have been using it for months and now the whole family uses it. What a treasure!”-Teresa N  

“I have tried everything for Chafing..larger women have this problem, walking, running, biking etc. I put this on and within a minute there was instant relief! The next morning it had healed the area entirely! Absolutely amazing!”-MJS  

“I have used this recently as a hair pomade, it is the best ever. Oil pomades are terrible because of the petrolatum, mineral oils, and other harmful ingredients, but they work the best. Water based pomades are not great, and will never give you that Cary Grant hold or shine. Finally, a hair pomade that is great for your hair and works! Nice work!”-SB  

“(I am of African American and Arabic decent and) I apply it to my wavy hair and scalp, lips, body, especially hands and feet (Even my face which I usually avoid putting anything on because it usually breaks me out due to my combination of dry AND oily sensitive skin). Also, I have completely stopped using to treat my eczema. Waxelene works just fine. I feel better about my skin absorbing organic products opposed to petroleum jelly laying on it clogging my pores (not allowing my hair to breathe and grow to its full potential). I love your product. Thank you for putting forth an effort to create something for us who prefer the more natural products.”-A.N.  

“I’m so glad I decided to try Waxelene. I’ve found that I have to mix other body lotions with something else, just to get enough moisture into my skin. But Waxelene by itself is just perfect for my often dry skin. I really like the smooth consistency and light, honey scent. I especially appreciate that after using Waxelene, I can go for hours not needing to reapply anything at all.”-O.B.  

“I have eczema and I’m always on the hunt for a product like this. I just found Waxelene today at Rainbow Grocery and I love the glass jar and the 9 oz. size. Thank you for making this product!”-J.M.  

“We use Waxelene for ourselves and our baby, we love it! It’s great for dry hands, and helps diaper rash too.”-The Jacobsens  

“I recently purchased Waxelene and it works great. I put it on my feet at night and it makes them feel extra soft the next day!”-Lora  

“As a surfer, I often get a rash around my neck from my wetsuit. I used to use the old PJ, but no longer. Waxelene really helps and stays on while I’m in the water.”-John M.  

“I’ve been using Waxelene as a cycling chamois creme for a couple of weeks and….it’s great. Better (fewer saddle sores) than more expensive products like DZ Nuts, Ozone, Assos. After a four hour double day yesterday, including a mostly in-the-saddle climb up Rist Canyon Road (20K climb) –nothing.”-R.B.  

“A friend gave this to me to take to Philadelphia to use on my incisions post surgery. I apply it to my face where I had the surgery because I was starting to peel like a snake! Waxelene completely covers the dryness and no one can tell that I am flaking! I love your product!”-S.L.  

“I had some eczema / dry spots on my eye lids that were pretty bad. I had been dealing with it for about 2 months. I tried hydrocortisone, creams, lotions, A&D ointment – and nothing worked. I used the Waxelene for the past 4 days, and it cleared up!!! I am so excited… lol. I can honestly say that I will be buying this product religiously for my skin care. Thank you again for introducing me to this great product.”-K.B.  

“Thank you so much for making this product! Although not a regular shopper at Whole Foods, I was there looking for organic chocolate stocking stuffers for Christmas when I saw a gentleman with your display. One little dab and I knew I needed this stuff. It’s really dry here in Colorado all year round, and this is the best hand/foot/face/elbow/scratch/lip product I’ve ever used. Even better than Deep Emollient Night Creme, which I’ve used for a long time for all the above mentioned uses. I’ll be picking up jars of this for several friends on my next shopping foray. This stuff is the nuts! And it smells great!”-Tina P.  

“I use Waxelene on my lips, hands and granddaughters bottom.”-Allen Cooper MD, Professor Emeritus Stanford University  

“Waxelene is the best! I have been using Waxelene for a couple weeks now and it has made all the difference in the world! I use it on my face as a moisturizer and it does not only leave my face moisturized; but it also imparts a healthy dewy glow. I like it better than any moisturizer I have used before and I know I will be using it for years to come. Thanks for making such a great product.”-D.T.  

“I finally found your product at Whole Foods…so excited…so far it has made my lips soft and less dry…my hands as well…I bought a small jar but will bump up to the bigger jar in order to moisturize the entire family…Thanks for such an awesome product!”-Y.E.  

“My whole family uses Waxelene. Especially my daughter. She gets dry, scaly patches on her face but every other product she’s tried (including from her doctor!) break her skin out. Waxelene is like a miracle for her! She uses it every night and it does wonders! Thank you for such a wonderful product!!”-J.L.  

“I just want to tell you how much I love Waxelene. I’m trying to find natural, good-for-me, good-for-the-planet alternatives to the products I normally use and Waxelene has become part of my beauty routine. I use it as a lip moisturizer, for dry patches on my face, and on my hands and cuticles. I’ve tossed the icky jars of Vaseline I used to use and will never go back to. Thank you for this product!”-Joanna L.  

“I just want to say I love love Waxelene!!! This product has worked so well on my baby’s bottom and helped get rid of his diaper rash. Thank you!”-Heather Brown Adams  

“I am SO glad I found waxelene at my local Bed, Bath & Beyond store. I have been looking for an alternative to vaselene for my lips for some time and nothing else I’ve used has worked. I wanted the same kind of coverage/protection that vaselene gave me and your product is wonderful. It feels just as protective yet even better than vaselene. So so glad that you make this. “-JAB  

“Waxelene has been awesome on my daughters diaper rash! I had tried 4 other (supposed) natural products that did nothing to help, but only 2 applications of Waxelene and rash was GONE! Awesome stuff!”-Patty Bloom Bucken  

“I love waxelene! I use it for hands, feet and diaper area. I really love it to soothe the red chapped skin on my baby’s neck. It also smells so heavenly! Thank you for making such a wonderful product!”-Heather Hobbs  

“I love it because its natural. I use it on my hands, arms, legs, to remove makeup, under my eyes at night, and rub a bit into my eyebrows before plucking to ease the pain. #waxelene.”-Terri Lynn Shelton Barger  

“I love Waxelene because it is the ONLY thing that helps my daughters eczema!”-Joelle Sailers  

“Why do I love Waxelene? Because it removes the caked on mascara under my eyes, it moisturizes my “chicken skin” arms, it is my night time face moisturizer, my lip balm. If you have skin on your body…you absolutely need this product.”-Rebecca DeLawder Linn  

“I first discovered Waxelene when I picked up a tube at the grocery store. When I got a bad sunburn on July 4th, I was frantically looking for something to soothe the burn. I applied Waxelene and it worked! I didn’t even peel! Now I use it for everything from a makeup remover, lip moisturizer, on my cuticles, on my feet, the list is endless! I love you Waxelene!”-Kimberly Todd  

“I LOVE Waxelene because it’s amazing on my sons super sensitive skin!!! I give it to all new mothers, it’s definitely a must have.”-Jennifer Jensen  

“This is my first time hearing about an alternative to petroleum jelly and I was excited when I got chosen to try it. I mostly use it on my lips and I can definitely feel and see an improvement to my lips which can be dry or cracked sometimes whenever I use lip product. I also tried it on my face where I have dry spots. There’s improvement in those areas as well. Waxelene doesn’t feel heavy or suffocating.”-Jean C  

“I really lovee Waxelene. First, I used it as a chapstick (me & the boyfriend had pretty chapped lips) and it worked amazingly. Then we used it on dry parts of our skin, once again, works amazing. I love everything about this product – very natural, very soft. Highly recommended!”-Marleebaby  

“Waxelene is a great replacement for petroleum jelly. I used it to remove my makeup, on my child’s diaper area, and to moisturize and it did the same job petroleum jelly does but better. When I smell it I can smell the Rosemary oil in it and I like that it doesn’t have an un natural perfume smell. I definitely would recommend this product and will probably purchase it after I have gone through all the samples.”-Marshall  

“OMG I LOVE THIS! First of all I have very sensitive skin. I had no issues with this product. It isn’t greasy, it has taken 10 years off my hands!!! The smell is a lightly wood (of some type. I just can’t put my finger on this pleasant smell). It does take awhile to be completely absorbed into my hands (which isn’t a bad thing since it isn’t greasy).”-Lori T  

“Waxelene is the perfect substitute for petroleum jelly. In fact I’d go so far as to say that it’s superior to petroleum jelly. It has a pleasant mild scent, and actually absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy layer like petroleum jelly tends to do. I use Waxelene regular!”-April J  

“I absolutely love this product I was glad I could try it I was suffering from really chap lips starting 3 days before I got and I dont like others because they feel like greasy but this one went on smooth and helped heal my poor burning lips. I would recommend for sure – it works great. Gonna buy it again!”-Amber  

“I absolutely love this for removing eye makeup residue after washing my face. I use a waterproof mascara and when I washed my face I would still have the black rings under my eyes from it. I would just dab a little bit of Waxelene on it making sure not to get any in my eyes. let it sit for about 30 seconds to a minute and it would all wipe right off. Didn’t even have to rub hard. LOVE IT for this. Took it all right off. I also used it for lip balm and it did a great job!!! The only thing I didn’t like is that it came out kind of clumpy but I assume that was from the type if sample package it was in. Great product.”-Stacy F  

“This is a very good product with a wide range of uses. Its light enough to wear on lips to prevent chapping and also good as a moisturizer for dry and cracking skin.I found it quite effective for my needs. I would recommend this product in place of regular Vaseline, Its light, wont clog your pores and has a great smell. Its worth purchasing since it has many uses.”-Roshall F  

“I received a sample of Waxelene from Swaggable. The first thing I noticed that it is made in the USA! Love that, and that it is all natural with only a handful of ingredients that I know and trust and as an animal advocate, proud to say this product is NOT tested on animals. I love that it is also herb infused with Rosemary. I am an avid home gardener, and used it on my hands after gardening. It glides on easily and it is clear. No greasy feel, and made my hands look and feel moisturized and well cared for. I also used it on my lips to prevent chapping. Again, went on effortlessly with no greasy film, and kept my lips soft and pampered. I would definitely recommend Waxelene to anyone that wants to use a chemical free beauty product!”-Kitty S  

“This, first of all, smells so much better than petroleum jelly. The texture is very smooth and not oily at all. I would purchase this product over the jelly. I like that it is made in America too!”-Carrie M  

“It’s a great all natural alternative to petroleum jelly. It smells great and it’s really useful on coarser textures for styling and moisturizing your hair without leaving your hair greasy. I can’t wait to find more uses for Waxelene, I love it!”-Mikoairaya                         Home | Shop | About | News | FAQ | Testimonials | Reviews | Terms and Conditions | Privacy Policy

- “As a pediatrician, I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day. I have been doing that for more than 20 years! They crack and bleed. I have tried every product out there….some are too oily, some burn as they soak in, some get absorbed and don’t make a difference. Waxelene is different. It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used!” Jill AirolaMD FAAP
- “As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.” Elke Von FreudenbergCelebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon
- “I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.” Joanna Simkincelebrity makeup artist

- “As a pediatrician, I wash my hands between 20 and 30 times each day. I have been doing that for more than 20 years! They crack and bleed. I have tried every product out there….some are too oily, some burn as they soak in, some get absorbed and don’t make a difference. Waxelene is different. It stays on and keeps my hands from drying out. It feels so nice and it smells fabulous! I now have a jar of Waxelene on my desk at my office, in my car and at home. My pediatric colleagues have jars of Waxelene on their desks. Many of my patients now use Waxelene for diaper rashes or skin rashes like eczema. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used!” Jill AirolaMD FAAP
- “As an eyebrow specialist, I look for products that have natural ingredients & do not irritate the skin-especially skin near the delicate eye area. Waxelene fits the bill perfectly. We get consistent, positive feedback from clients that Waxelene does not clog their pores or causes skin breakouts following hair removal treatments. This product is a wonderful Godsend for our clients. Thank you for putting this great product on the market.” Elke Von FreudenbergCelebrity Brow Specialist The Elke Von Freudenberg Salon
- “I use it and I love it! It’s a great makeup remover, great for sheen on the legs/arms and I gave some to my friend Jeanna who loves it for her baby.” Joanna Simkincelebrity makeup artist

Where do I buy Waxelene? 

You can buy Waxelene online here. You can find Waxelene at these retail locations. 

What makes Waxelene different? 

Waxelene is made with a patented aeration process that creates the first ever breathable waterproof barrier. Waxelene creates the same waterproof barrier doctors recommend, but has no petroleum or hydrogenated oils. This allows Waxelene to work better than petroleum jelly because it addresses all three aspects of skin care: a waterproof barrier, breathability and organic, natural oils. 

What is Waxelene? 

Waxelene is the petroleum jelly alternative – made from natural, pesticide-free beeswax and 3 of the highest quality natural & organic oils.  Waxelene is smooth, rich and creamy. Our patented aeration process allows the skin to breathe. 

What can it be used for? 

Waxelene can be used for many types of skin issues – from chapped lips to chafing to skin protection! It’s also great for various make-up applications, baby diaper irritation, skin conditions, removing makeup, after shave and many more uses. See our video for more info. 

What are the ingredients? 

Waxelene has only 4 natural and organic ingredients! Organic GMO-free soy oil, natural & unbleached raw beeswax, natural vitamin E oil and organic rosemary oil. No hidden ingredients, such as synthetic preservatives, dyes, perfumes, or thickeners. 

What is the texture like? 

Waxelene has a soft, rich, creamy texture that goes on clear and smooth. It protects skin for hours without feeling greasy. 

Is there petroleum in it? 

NO! There are absolutely no petroleum-based or petroleum-derived ingredients of any kind in Waxelene. 

Do the oils come from GMO (genetically modified) sources? 

No! Waxelene’s raw ingredients are obtained from certified organic, non-GMO suppliers. 

Is it safe for my baby? 

Yes! Many of our customers use Waxelene to their child’s skin with great success. Parents may want to do a small spot-test on their child’s skin to make sure that no reaction occurs. 

Is it safe for cloth diapers? 

Yes! Waxelene is safe for cloth diapers and will wash out. 

Can I use it on my pet? 

Yes, many of our customers use it on their pet’s skin. Check with your veterinarian first if you are uncertain or if you notice any sort of reaction. 

Is it tested on animals? 

No! Never have, never will! We are certified cruelty-free by PETA and Leaping Bunny, who are leading animal-rights groups. 

How long will my jar/tube stay good? 

Waxelene has a “best by” date of 3 years. It may last longer if kept at room temperature or in a cool place. However, avoid leaving Waxelene in a hot location for a length of time, since it is a natural product. 

Is Waxelene sustainable? 

Yes! Our ingredients are all natural, our facility is powered with 100% wind power, our boxes are all 100% recycled, and we source the most sustainable packaging we can get. We use recyclable glass jars and any plastics used are BPA-free. 

Where is Waxelene made? 

Waxelene is made in California, USA. 

What do people think of Waxelene? 

They love it! We get glowing reviews each and every day. See our testimonials by doctors, industry professionals and regular users. Also see our reviews by bloggers, major magazines and other news outlets.

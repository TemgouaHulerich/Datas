Welcome To Terroirs Export Web SiteThis is for you!If you are an Importer or a  distributor looking for some crafted french wineries, a wine drinker looking for information about various wines or a wine maker with an interest to discuss  your export market, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will be very happy to chat with you about our mutual interest and passion.What about Terroirs?

The Terroir can be very loosely translated as "a sense of place," which is embodied in certain characteristic qualities, the sum of the effects that the local environment has had on the production of the product. 
In fact this is much more complexe than that.
The concept of terroir is at the base of the French wine Appellation d'origine Protegee (AOP) system that has been the model for appellation and wine laws across the globe. At its core is the assumption that the land from which the grapes are grown imparts a unique quality that is specific to that growing site. The amount of influence and the scope that falls under the description of terroir has been a controversial topic in the wine industry because it does also include some none mesurable elements such as the philosophy and the spirit of the wine maker.

Our company name makes reference to the "Terroirs" because this is the reason why we love wine: The diversity. Terroirs Export is representing wines that have a spirit and their own caracteristics. No wines should taste like an other one, even if it comes from the same grape from the same location and that the grape grown during the same vintage. The winegrower's hand is also part of it and this is why that notion is so complex and controversial.

Chateau de Cranne - BordeauxSommaireChateau de Cranne - BordeauxChateau Venus - Graves

Sixth GENERATION: Vincent LACOSTE took over in 2008.
Our history begins when Jean VILLARS bought the vines and mix crops lands in 1833, then he acquired the house   August the 20th in 1839.
Younger, Vincent was not interested in the vineyard. It is trough his studies in the Agriculture Superior School of Angers (ESA) that his motivation grew to continue the legacy of five generations dedicated to the production of wine. In the region of Anjou Vincent talked with wine producers who are involved in Organic Agriculture and his concern begins to grow until January of 2010 when I took the decision to change all the production into organic. 
The quality of our wines is directly linked to the terroir and its own expression, with a specific geographical area, the type of soil, and favorable climatic conditions. knowledge and experience allow us to offer you a variety of wines with their own characteristics, flavors and personalities.What About Côtes De BordeauxCotes de Bordeaux is the youngest AOC appellation in Bordeaux. Cotes de Bordeaux was created in 2009, when the INAO declared the merging of four, previously recognized communes, Cotes de Blaye, Cotes de Bordeaux, Cotes de Castillon and Cotes de Francs. The following changes took place for wines labeled Cotes de Bordeaux starting with the 2009 vintage. Wines from Cotes de Castillon became Castillon Cotes de Bordeaux, Cotes de Francs became Francs Cotes de Bordeaux, Premieres Cotes de Blaye became Blaye Cotes de Bordeaux and Premieres Cotes de Bordeaux Rouge became Cadillac Cotes de Bordeaux.
While the Cotes de Bordeaux appellation was officially created in 2009, the genesis of the idea was planted in 1985 when the separate, but distinctive regions banded together to create the Association de Cotes de Bordeaux. The named eventually changed to Les Cinq Côtes de Bordeaux, to include additional appellations. Things started coming together by 2003, and in 2009, the new Cotes de Bordeaux appellation was created with the purpose of helping to promote the wines from the previously separate appellations as a united group.
The specific areas were chosen because they shared similar terroirs of gravel, clay and limestone soils. Another consideration was the fact that the vast majority of the wines produced in those soils were dominated by the Merlot grape. One problem, or virtue, (Depending on your point of view) found in the new appellation is the ability for producers from any terroir in the now, very large Cotes de Bordeaux appellation to incorporate grapes from any of the previously, separate appellations; Cotes de Castillon, Cotes de Blaye, Cotes de Bordeaux and Cotes de Francs into their wine.
For more information on Cotes de Bordeaux www.bordeaux-cotes.com 
Why Working with Vincent Lacoste at Chateau de Cranne

As always, I have been in contact with Vincent thru a mutual friends. I was not working with Bordeaux but wanted to work with one family producing some Côtes de Bordeaux as I think this is where we can find value in that vast region. We meet, discuss and tasted his wines and decided to work together. On the top Vincent is producing some Loupiac and offer me to work with of one his friend in Graves: Chateau Venus

Domaine Specht - AlsaceSommaireDomaine Specht - Alsace

Domaine Specht is located in Mittelwihr, small village of 1000 people on the wine road in the heart of the Alsacian vineyard. Created in 1955 by Alfred Specht, it is 11 Hectars big devided in 40 plots which are located thru the area of Mittelwihr and on the more well known villages of Beblenheim, Riquewihr and Ribeauvillé.
Domaine Specht grow and produce all the grapes allowed in the Alsace vineyard with a special focus on the Local Grand Cru Mandelberg where they grow only Riesling and Gewurztraminer.
The vines are ideally located on the « Under Vosges » hills around these villages. Each plot are separetly work out to get the best out of each one.
Domaine Specht is run by the 2 brothers Denis and Jean Paul. Early 2016, their sons Benjamin and Thibault came onboard. Jean Paul will retire late this year and denis at the end of 2017.What About the Alsace Wine?

As a wine region, Alsace stands apart from the rest of France. The reasons for this are both geographical and historical. Geographically, the province of Alsace is isolated on the west by the Vosges mountains and on the east by the river Rhine. Historically, there have been frequent disputes as to which of these two was the natural boundary of France, or of Germany, for the matter.
The Wine villages lie in a narrow band 140 kilometres long, at the foot of the Vosges.The better vineyards are situated on the lower slopes, which face due east and can be as steep as 65%. Exposed to the early morning sun, they gain the maximum benefit from its rays throughout the day. The best wines of all come from the Haut Rhin, aound the town of Colmar, where is Mittelwihr and the Specht Vineyard.
Alsace differs from other area of France in that it is generally the grape variety that is dominant feature on the label.

Why Having Domaine Specht With Terroirs export?

I knew Domaine Specht's Owner Denis Specht during a Wine Tasting in Germany. I tasted his wines and really enjoyed them. I also liked the man and how he talk about his wines and his work.
It was very important for me to work with an Alsace Producer since their  grapes doesn't grow anywhere else in France.View of the Vallee from the Top of RibeauvilleThe German border is at the bottom of the screen, the village of Ribeauville down the hill and Beblenheim on the right hand side of Ribeauville from your point of view. Mittelwhir is behind Beblenhein, on the other side of the small hill. The vine around us are Pinot Blanc.Harvest With SpechtMittelwhir is located between Beblenheim, Ribauvillé and Colmar

Click here to download their impressive Press Book.


Where is located Dumangin & Fils?

The family vineyard is located in Chigny-les-Roses, an historical district classified Premier Cru nestling on the slopes of the Montagne de Reims.
The name Chigny-les-Roses is relatively recent. Emile Loubet, erstwhile President of the Republic, decided in 1902 to ratify the change of name from Chigny-en-Montagne to Chigny-les-Roses, justified by the presence in the village of a famous rose garden, greatly admired by its many visitors.
Jean Dumangin Champagne has very deep roots, dating back several centuries. The current family represents the eleventh generation. According to our painstaking research it is possible to go back with certainty to Firmin Dumangin – a vine-grower in Ludes, born in 1645 – to find the first traces of the family’s wine-making origins.

It was in the second part of the 17th century that the wine-makers began to produce a white wine called “vin gris”, obtained using an appropriate pressing of black grapes with a colourless flesh. It was also the period when Dom Pérignon, the monk and cellar master at the Benedictine Abbey of Hautvillers, discovered how to put the sparkle into wine between 1668 and 1715, along with the art of blending grapes before pressing them. 

Why Having Champagne Dumangin With Terroirs Export?

I knew Gilles for long time but we never think about working together. Our commun friend, Christophe Chapillon who produced wines in Spain encourage us to work together in the USA.
We talk about it and it became very natural that we should be working together.
I love his champagne because they are as Champagne should be : Pure, clean and very elegant.

About Us

Terroirs Export was created in July 2013 by Thibault Poisson.
We act as the Export Department for all of our wineries. 
We only represent high-quality, family owned wineries who share our philosophy towards sustainable, organic and/or biodynamic farming practices. These winegrower's have a great understanding of their regions, soils and vines.  Their main goal is not about production levels but to best express their unique terroirs.
Terroirs export handles the complexities of exporting their wines so they could concentrate on their main job: growing vines and making great wines. We strive to create a portfolio that is balanced and original while bringing excellent wines and excellent value to our importers and distributors.A passion for wine...

I come from a non-winemaking family and grow up in Normandy, far away from any vineyard. However, my family and I enjoyed drinking wine. So much so that it led me to decide I was going to work in the wine industry.
After graduating from IPAG Business school, I studied in Burgundy for one year. I learned as much as possible about wines while taking some formal classes at CFPPA.  I followed that with practical winemaking experience as I worked as the assistant wine maker at Pavilon de Chavanne in Cote de Brouilly and Lupé Cholet in Nuit St Georges.
After that enriching experience travelling thru french and foreign vineyards and learning about all aspects of wine, I went to live in the USA. I spent 4 years in Houston,Texas and worked as the wine manager for Global Quality Import; an importer and distributor of fine wine and liquors.
I returned to France in early 2006 and spent almost 8 years with the Feray Family, owner of Chateau Moncontour in the Loire Valley, as their export Manager.
I started Terroirs export because I wanted to work with different vineyards, different people and different wines. I also plan to build the commercial structure that one day will allow me to sell wines from my own vineyards.International Partnerships

Terroirs Export works in cooperation with Christophe CHAPILLON (specialist of Spanish wines), and PASCAL SCHILDT (specialist of South African Wines) to promote all of our different wineries.
Our houses have grown with the same passion for wine and its expression and respect of terroir. We have decided to share our knowledge of the International Market while proposing an even deeper portfolio.

Domaine Castel Oualou - LiracSommaireDomaine Castel Oualou - LiracDomaine de la Lyre - Côtes du RhôneChateau des Roques - VacqueyrasChateau de Ruth - Côtes du Rhone and Chateauneuf du PapeThe vineyard :

Domain Castel Oualou was created in 1961 in the heart of Lirac's vinyard. Jean François Assemat after his studies in oenology decided to buy  some land in the Lirac area. The vines were fallowed, they were cultivated before the phylloxera attack. After some time and efforts he managed to bring the vines back in even a better shape that they were before. The vines are on sandy and clay soil, ploughing and treatments in the vineyards are carried out with due consideration for Nature.The wines are TERRA VITIS certified. which is another cetification than Organic but similar. The average age of the vines is 50 years.About Lirac :

Lirac is a french wine growing area (AOC)  in the department of Gard situated in the low hills along the right bank of the Rhône river in the southern Rhône wine region of France. It was named after the village "Lirac" a tiny place with only 850 inhabitants. In 1945 after years of improving their techniques, Lirac obtained the highest distinction an became a cru, one of the 13 crus of the Rhône valley family. On the opposite river bank is the famous Châteauneuf-du-Pape vineyard. Lirac is the oldest wine in the Côtes du Rhône region and was the first to be produced in all three colours: red, rosé, and white.

After several wines experiences in France and abroad, Benoit DARIDAN took over in 2001 the 15 hectares family vineyard. He is the 10th Generation.
The vineyard is located in the heart of the Loire valley; In Cour Cheverny between the 2 famous “Chateau de Cheverny” and “Château de Chambord”.
The characteristic of that vineyard is a 2 Hectars section of 50 year old vines wich has the Appellation “Cour Cheverny”. The unique grape variety for this small appellation is the “Romorantin” (established by the king Francois 1st) What is Cheverny?

Cheverny is a French wine region in the Loire Valley that makes dry white wines, light red wines and rosé wines. The area received AOVDQS (Appellation d'Origine Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure) status in 1973, and then AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) on 26 March 1993 when new regulatory laws were passed. The wine region is spread over 532 hectares, within 24 communes of the Loir-et-Cher department.
The white wines are composed of Sauvignon blanc grapes, at a proportion of 60%–80%, blended with Arbois, Chardonnay or Pineau Blanc de la Loire grapes. A small proportion is made into sparkling wine. The red wines are composed of Gamay grapes, at a proportion of 40%–65%, blended with Pinot noir grapes. Cabernet Franc and Côt can be used to make up to 15% of the wine. Pineau d'Aunis is added to these grape varieties when making rosés.
What is Cour Cheverny?

Cour-Cheverny is a 48 hectare wine appellation in the Loire Valley north east of Tours. The vineyards are scattered in small parcels over 11 communes in the Loir-et-Cher département (Cellettes, Cheverny, Chitenay, Cormeray, Cour-Cheverny, Huisseau-sur-Cosson, Mont-près-Chambord, Montlivault, Saint-Claude-de-Diray, Tour-en-Sologne and Vineuil).It is a young appellation having been proclaimed in 1997. It is of some interest to wine enthusiasts as only white wine is produced from the little known Romorantin grape.The Romorantin grape has grown in the Loire Valley since the sixteenth century. It makes crisp, acidic, minerally white wines.
Legend has it that Romorantin was introduced to the Loire by King Francis I of France (1494–1547).  
DNA fingerprinting has shown that it is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais blanc and Pinot fin teinturier, making it a sibling of famous varieties such as Chardonnay and Aligoté.Why Having Benoit Daridan With Terroirs Export?

The Cheverny and Cour Cheverny Appellation are almost unknown abroad. Leaving in Blois for 7 years, I wanted to promote the vineyard close by.
Every body around me was talking about Daridan. I tasted the wines few times with friends and familly and really enjoyed them a lot.
I went to meet with Benoit and we decided to work together.

She was elected winemaker of the year in 2018 by the famous french review "Le Guide Hachette". Their sustainable farming methods give rise to delicious and characterful wines true to their terroir.

The domaine comprises 50ha and natural ferments and very little use of new oak for maturation let the soils and climate from this region express themselves fully.Why Having Domaine Piquemal With Terroirs Export?

I was in School in Beaune with Marie Pierre. I did not really know wines from Roussillon before to meet with her. I liked her wines and it has been very natural to start working together for some export market.

Why Having Chateau Nozieres With Terroirs Export?

I know the Guitard Family for almost 7 years and when I decided to start that company, we talk with Olivier about his Export Market.
He was not working in the US so he asked me to take care of it to start.
